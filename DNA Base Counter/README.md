# DNA BASE COUNTER
The folder contains Python code that I used to calculate the number of bases in a DNA sequence. The purpose of this Python code is to complete the challenge on the website https://rosalind.info/problems/dna/.

## Algoritma and Method
Step 1: Input the DNA sequence into the “DNA” variable and save it as a string.
Step 2: I use a 'for' loop to take each base in the DNA variable and move it to a new variable (A, C, T, G).
Step 3: I call the “len()” function to see the number of bases in each variable A, C, T, G.

## How to Run the Program
To run this program, make sure you have Python installed, then copy the code and run it in your Python.
